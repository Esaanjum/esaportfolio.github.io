							<p class="emPara">In this project, I have performed a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to 
                                find out top careers of 
                                the MBTI personality type <strong>'ESFP'</strong> (nicknamed <em>The Entertainer</em>)
							</p>
                            <p class="emPara">
                                The data was collected from <a href="https://www.personality-database.com/" target="_blank">personality database website</a> 
                                that contains information related to personalities of famous people.
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>Data is loaded with pandas from an excel file that contains all the personality types data:</p>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>Afterwards, the data cleaning part is followed. Encoding is normalized so that there are no invalid characters in our data.</p>
                            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mbti analysis images/normalize encoding.png" alt="">

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>When viewing our data above, we see that there are similar careers that belong to one single category of careers.
                                For example, <em>'Pop & Contemporary'</em> and <em>'Kpop'</em> belong to the same career i.e. <em>'Music'</em>. 
                                We want to group all these careers together so that our final graph plots all the closely related careers as one. 
                                To do that, I have taken help from ChatGPT to put similar careers together with their respective general categories
                                 in a python dictionary and then use that dictionary to simplify the names.
                            </p>

                            <span>Careers before generalizing names:
                                <br>
                                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mbti analysis images/distinct careers.png" alt="">
                            </span>
                            <br>
                            <span>Careers after generalizing names:
                                <br>

                            </span>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                               There were still some records of people present in vague categories. 
                               So, I had to add them manually (ChatGPT comes to the resue once again!).
                            </p>
                            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mbti analysis images/individual careers.png" alt="">

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Here, we drop the data that has fictional/mythological figures. For that, 
                                I had already marked them for <strike>death</strike> removal with specific names.
                            </p>
                            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mbti analysis images/drop rows.png" alt="">

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Finally, we save all the 3145 rows of data into an excel file.
                            </p>
                            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mbti analysis images/save data.png" alt="">

                            <br>

                            <p>
                                To plot a bar chart of <strong>percentage of mbti type</strong> vs <strong>career</strong>,
                                I have created a script that can be reused for other personality types as well. Using that,
                                we plot a bar chart of the top 5 careers found among the people of that personality type.
                            </p>
                            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mbti analysis images/code for bar chart.png" alt="">
                            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mbti analysis images/bar chart esfp.png" alt="">

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h6>
                                Conclusion:
                            </h6>
                            <p>
                                By seeing the chart above, we can conclude that an overwhelming majority (>95%) of 
                                celebrities of the <em>'ESFP'</em> mbti type belong to the entertainment industry. 
                                Interestingly, this result also justifies their title of being 
                                <em>'The Entertainer'</em> type as well!
                            </p>
